# Ohara

![pipeline-screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oharastream/ohara-docs/master/assets/images/pipeline_screenshot.jpg)

Ohara is a scalable streaming platform, that allows users to easily organized their input, output, and streaming applications with a clean and comprehensive GUI.

The streaming application ([Stream](https://oharastream.github.io/en/docs/master/custom_stream/)) contains the business logic defined by the user. By combining the applications with the default FTP, JDBC, HDFS, or [custom connectors](https://oharastream.github.io/en/docs/master/custom_connector/), a user can construct a scalable pipeline with full control.

Ohara provides an architecture to scale, so the users can focus on their business logic and their main applications.
